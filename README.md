# agile-iflux
This project is a use scenario for Iflux and the Github API.

A basic example is found in the "simplest" folder. 

This repository contains both the program uploaded to the ESP8266 module and the source code for the Github broker (which transforms Github webhook requests into Iflux-readable ones).
